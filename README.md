# ActivityNavigator App

## Overview

This project demonstrates the "ActivityNavigator" Android app, aimed at showcasing basic Android app navigation principles. As a software engineer, I created this app to further my learning in app development.

## Description

The "ActivityNavigator" app illustrates how to navigate between different activities (pages) in Android Studio. The app includes three main pages:

1. **Main Page**: The starting page with a button to navigate to Activity1.
2. **Activity1**: A secondary page accessed from the Main Page. It includes a button to proceed to Activity2.
3. **Activity2**: The final page, accessible from Activity1.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this app is to serve as an educational tool. It demonstrates how to create and navigate between different activities, a fundamental concept in Android app development.
